# ML-supervised-challenge

This assignment examines the differences in performance of the Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models on lending risk.

Both models are run on a training set from 2019 and the compared to performance on a testing set from the first quarter of 2020. This is first done using the original data, and then they are run again with scaled data.
